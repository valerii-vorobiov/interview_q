Simple Database
===


In the Simple Database problem, you'll implement an in-memory database similar to Redis. 
Your program will receive commands via standard input (stdin), and should write appropriate responses to standard output (stdout).

### Data Commands
Your database should accept the following commands:

**SET name** value – Set the variable name to the value value. Neither variable names nor values will contain spaces.

**GET name** – Print out the value of the variable name, or NULL if that variable is not set.

**UNSET name** – Unset the variable name, making it just like that variable was never set.

**NUMEQUALTO value** – Print out the number of variables that are currently set to value. If no variables equal that value, print 0.

**END** – Exit the program. Your program will always receive this as its last command.

Commands will be fed to your program one at a time, with each command on its own line. Any output that your program generates should end with a newline character. Here are some example command sequences:

```
INPUT	    OUTPUT
SET ex 10   
GET ex      10
UNSET ex
GET ex      NULL
END
```

```
INPUT	        OUTPUT
SET a 10
SET b 10
NUMEQUALTO 10   2
NUMEQUALTO 20   0
SET b 30
NUMEQUALTO 10   1
END
```

### Transaction Commands
In addition to the above data commands, your program should also support database transactions by also implementing these commands:

**BEGIN** – Open a new transaction block. Transaction blocks can be nested; a BEGIN can be issued inside of an existing block.

**ROLLBACK** – Undo all of the commands issues in the most recent transaction block, and close the block. Print nothing if successful, or print NO TRANSACTION if no transaction is in progress.

**COMMIT** – Close all open transaction blocks, permanently applying the changes made in them. Print nothing if successful, or print NO TRANSACTION if no transaction is in progress.

Any data command that is run outside of a transaction block should commit immediately. Here are some example command sequences:

```
INPUT	    OUTPUT
BEGIN
SET a 10
GET a       10
BEGIN
SET a 20
GET a       20
ROLLBACK
GET a       10
ROLLBACK
GET a       NULL
END
```

```
INPUT	    OUTPUT
BEGIN
SET a 30
BEGIN
SET a 40
COMMIT
GET a       40
ROLLBACK    NO TRANSACTION
END
```

```
INPUT       OUTPUT
SET a 50
BEGIN
GET a       50
SET a 60
BEGIN
UNSET a
GET a       NULL
ROLLBACK
GET a       60
COMMIT
GET a       60
END
```

```
INPUT	        OUTPUT
SET a 10
BEGIN
NUMEQUALTO 10   1
BEGIN
UNSET a
NUMEQUALTO 10   0
ROLLBACK
NUMEQUALTO 10   1
COMMIT
END
```

### Performance Considerations

Let's prioritize correctness insead of performance first.
